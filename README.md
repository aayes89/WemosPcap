# WemosPcap
ESP8266 network analyzer

Using a Wemos D1 with ESP8266 to capture raw packets from a wireless network.

I added a Python script to capture the data from the serial port regardless of the operating system, this script generates a .pcap file that can be used by Wireshark.

# TODO
* Add pcap support
* Send the data obtained in pcap standard via serial port
